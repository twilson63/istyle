# istyle

istyle CLI is a tool that takes a name of one of 10 plus markdown styles and writes the style css as stdout, this way you can pipe it to other tools or a file.

```
istyle github > style.css
```

## Why?

The main purpose is to be a tool in the `ipress` tool chain that provides a simple way to add styles to my articles.

## What styles can I choose?

* 

> These styles were forked from https://github.com/mattstauffer/markedstyle and each style is credited in its comments. Thank you to Matt Stauffer and others, this CLI is just meant to be a simple way to add markdown styles to their articles.
